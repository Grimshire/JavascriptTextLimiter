# JavascriptTextLimiter
Limits the number of characters a user may use in a textbox in web development. Supports multiline. Easy to use and implement. Just add CSS classes and a couple javascript functions and it's off to the races!

No longer requires JQuery. This is now written in pure js.

You can now change text that follows the number of characters written out of the maximum possible characters.

Simply use:

```
JavaScriptLimiter.Text2Add = "";
```

if you'd like no text to follow the number ratio.
