# JavascriptTextLimiter
Limits the number of characters a user may use in a textbox in web development. Supports multiline. Easy to use and implement. Just add CSS classes and a couple javascript functions and it's off to the races!

*Note, as this snippet is written, it requires jquery. But it would be easy to rewrite in standard Javascript.
